          <h3>Forex Trading. Technology and Techniques</h3>
          <p>Forex trading professionals use various modern methods to forecast financial markets and to get better 
          trading results. Some of these methods are based on fundamental analysis of the market, while others rely 
          on a purely technical analysis. Indeed, the majority of traders use technical methods to create market 
          forecasts. This forecasting technique assumes that the historical movements of the market can be a factor 
          in predicting of future market behavior.</p>
          <p>Most traders today rely on bankers, stock traders, mutual fund managers and other financial experts; 
          in rare cases, professional traders may fully entrust their investments to their outside experts, who exploit
          knowledge about patterns in market curves and how geopolitics effects the trading environment. Some of these 
          experts rely solely on algorithmic trading through technical instruments, which can facilitate automated 
          trading. This automated trading requires exceptional knowledge and skill.</p>
          <p>The professional trading decision-making process is difficult to formalize. That said, an experienced 
          trader can guess where the market is going.</p>
          
          <h3>The challenges of developing automated trading patterns</h3>
          <p>Some patterns well known to professional traders such as 
          <a href="http://www.stator-afm.com/elliott-wave.html">Elliott Waves</a>, channels, 
          <a href ="http://www.stator-afm.com/w-d-gann.html">Gann Vibrations</a>. 
          These and many more recurring geometrical configurations of curves can express market behavior.</p>
          <p>These recurring patterns can express virtually any market behavior. In mathematical terms, 
          the self-similar structures are multifractal structures that are geometrically similar to each other. 
          However, formalizing these structures in order to forecast the market is an extremely complex task.</p>
          
          <h3>The gap between advertised results and real results of automated trading systems</h3>
          <p>Automated trading experts who can take advantage of recurring patterns they see in the market are often
          promoted as generating upwards of 400% in profit per month. Many websites state that their systems use the
          most modern forecasting methods – from the above mentioned wavelet analysis to neural networks.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the reality is that even if these experts are working efficiently, it is only in testing,
          or for a short period of time; a few months at best. As of today, it's possible to give only two examples 
          of successful solutions to practical problems of identifying multifractal structures. The first one is 
          methods of fractal compression of image files, proposed in the late 1980s by a British mathematician 
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Barnsley">Michael Barnsley</a>. The second example is used 
          in compression of standard graphic files <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_2000">jpg2000</a>. 
          A practical implementation of similar techniques for efficient financial market analysis is not 
          yet possible.</p>
          
          <h3>The Forex Jingle advantage</h3>
          <p>Forecasts at Forex Jingle are backed by a combination of technical methods and human experts. The technology
          stack, a so-called ‘forecast system’ uses the multifractal structures of the market along with professional 
          trading expertise. These structures are mathematically described by a system of nonlinear recursive functions.
          This is very similar to the methodology used by Barnsley.</p>
          <p>In the Forex Jingle system, the coefficients of the recursive functions are monitored and periodically 
          updated by a human expert. These technical methods are organized into a complex system built with modern 
          mathematical methods for digital data processing. The forecast system monitors the emergence of these 
          new market structures, compares them to the available baseline structures, and creates forecasts based 
          on the behavior history of these structures.</p>
          
          <h3>How Forex Jingle shows results</h3>
          <p>The forecast system has been tested and used by expert trading professionals for over two years. This system
          reliably generates 60-120% per quarter. The efficiency is even steadier over longer intervals of time.</p>
          <p>[There are advanced methods for increasing the monthly revenue percentage (higher risk vs higher pay off)
          which we will be presenting as a set of webinars shortly in the future.]</p>
          <p>The Forex Jingle system is presented through a web interface which delivers forecasts in the form of pending
          orders to the user’s browser on a PC, Mac, iPhone, iPad, Android etc. Each pending order arrives with all 
          parameters necessary to place the order. Immediate status notifications appear on the screen with no need 
          to refresh the page.</p> 
          <p>The web interface has been specifically designed for a daily use by those who trade Forex on regular 
          basis or who want to learn how to trade.</p>
          
          <h3>Forex Jingle is for experienced traders and learners</h3>
          <p>If you’re an experienced trader, Forex Jingle will help you spot the trading opportunities as soon as 
          they happen, so that you don’t have to spend sleepless nights or long hours trying to spot them yourself.</p>
          <p>For less experienced users, there is a good opportunity to learn to recognize these trading opportunities;
          once you have all the exact parameters, you can review them and try to see why the trading opportunity 
          is there.</p>
          
          <h3>Forex Jingle puts you in control</h3>
          <p>It is always up to you to make the final decision whether to place the order or not.</p>
          <p>After getting experience and confidence, you can begin defining your parameters to take more calculated 
          risks for a chance of higher profits. It’s your choice.</p>
          <p>All of the orders are carried out on our CMS Forex account, and the live results are posted to your 
          dashboard. Forex Jingle supports some of the most popular currency pairs and instruments.</p>
