      <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
      <article>
        <p>Pieoneers Web Technologies Inc, warns that trading in foreign exchange (“Forex”) can incur a risk of 
        substantial losses as well as profits. Please consider carefully whether such trading is suitable for you 
        based on your financial health and ability to handle financial risks.  Before trading or investing in Forex 
        you should read the <a href="Disclaimer.html">NFA and CFTC Required Disclaimer</a>, the
        <a href="Disclaimer.html">U.S. Government Required Disclaimer</a>, and the <a href="Disclaimer.html"> 
        ForexJingle Disclaimer</a>.</p>
        
        <h3>NFA and CTFC Required Disclaimers</h3>
        <p>Trading in the Foreign Exchange market is a challenging
        opportunity where above average returns are available for educated and experienced investors who are willing to
        take above average risk. However, before deciding to participate in Foreign Exchange (FX) trading, you should 
        carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience and risk appetite. Do not invest money 
        you cannot afford to lose.</p>
        
        <h3>CFTC Rule 4.41</h3>
        <p>Hypothetical or simulated performance results have certain limitations. 
        Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades
        have not been executed, the results may have under-or-over compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market
        factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they
        are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to 
        achieve profit or losses similar to those shown. No representation is being made that any account will, or is 
        likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those discussed within this site, support and texts. 
        Our course(s), products and services should be used as learning aids only and should not be used to invest 
        real money. If you decide to invest real money, all trading decisions should be your own.</p>
        
        <p> Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below. 
        No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to 
        those shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the 
        actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical
        performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical
        trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the 
        impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or adhere to a 
        particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect
        actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the 
        implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation 
        of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.</p>
        
        <h3>U.S. Government Required Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>Forex, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Futures and Options trading
        has large potential rewards, but also large potential risk. You must be aware of the risks and be willing to 
        accept them in order to invest in the futures and options markets. Don't trade with money you can't afford to
        lose. This is neither a solicitation nor an offer to Buy/Sell futures, stocks or options on the same. 
        No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar 
        to those discussed on this web site. The past performance of any trading system or methodology is not 
        necessarily indicative of future results. No guarantee is made that you will be able to replicate the same
