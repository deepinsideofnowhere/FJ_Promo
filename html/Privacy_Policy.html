        visit the ForexJingle.com site and/or use the ForexJingle service (<strong>“Services”</strong>). For example, you provide 
        us with personal information when you register for an account or contact us by email. We also automatically 
        receive and record information from your browser, including your IP address and cookies. The personal information
        collected is used for billing, identification, authentication, service improvement, research, and contact.</p>
        
        <h3>Consent</h3>
        <p>By using or accessing the Services, you consent to the use and disclosure of your Personal Information as 
        described in this Privacy Policy.   Your Personal Information will not be used for any other purpose or disclosed
        further without your consent.  You can withdraw your consent at any time but withdrawing consent may result in
        your inability to continue using certain features of the Services.</p>
        
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from our servers and stored on your computer’s
        hard drive. We use cookies to access information when you sign in, store your preferences, and to keep you logged
        in within the ForexJingle application. You can configure your browser to accept or reject these cookies.</p>
        
        <h3>Information Sharing</h3>
        <p>We do not sell, rent or share personal information with third parties without your prior consent. We may,
        however, disclose personal information when we believe it violates our <a href="Terms_of_Use.html">Terms of 
        Service</a> or is appropriate to comply with the law, to protect our or our users’ rights, as well as to protect
        our users from fraudulent, abusive, and unlawful use of our Services. We reserve the right to disclose your 
        personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect
        our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website. 
        We may also disclose your personal information in connection with a corporate re-organization, a merger or 
        amalgamation with another entity, a sale of all or a substantial portion of our assets or stock, including 
        any due diligence exercise carried out in relation to the same, provided that the information disclosed continues
        to be used for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring the information.</p>
        
        <h3>Third Party Sites & Links</h3>
        <p>The Services may include links to third party websites and advertisements.  We have no control over third 
        party websites and the provision of links in no way constitutes an endorsement, authorization or representation 
        of our connection to that third party.  If you access third party sites using links from the Services, you 
        should read the privacy policies of those sites and be aware that they may follow different rules regarding 
        the use or disclosure of your Personal Information.  In addition, third party web advertisers may set cookies. 
        These cookies allow the advertisement server operated by that third party to recognize your computer each time 
        they send you an online advertisement. Accordingly, advertisement servers may compile information about where 
        or whether you viewed their advertisements and which advertisements you clicked on. This information allows web
        advertisers to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.  Thise Privacy
        Policy applies to cookies placed on your computer by us, but does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party
        web advertisers.  For the privacy practices of such third-party web advertisers, you should consult the 
        applicable privacy policy for the relevant third-party web advertiser(s).</p>

        bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal 
        prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.  Our servers are located in the USA and accordingly your
